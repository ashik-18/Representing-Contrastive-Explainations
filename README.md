# Representing-Contrastive-Explainations

The project contains code to represent the contrastive explanation in the form of natural language or graphs. 

To run the code, add the log file that contains the contrastive explanation generated by the https://github.com/dice-group/contrastive_explanations model to the _logs_ folder. 

Copy the added log file path to the _verbaliser.sh_ or _graph_representation.sh_ script and run the script. verbaliser.sh also accepts a custom api key to run the desired LLM model to generate natural language. 

_verbaliser.sh_ converts the log file into natural language and the _graph_representation.sh_ converts the explanations into graphs. 

The result can be found the _output folder_.
